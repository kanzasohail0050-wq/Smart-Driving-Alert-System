# 📖 Overview

The **Smart Driving Alert System** is an embedded systems project developed using the **ESP32 DevKit V1**.

The project continuously monitors the driver's condition using:

* 🍺 MQ-3 Alcohol Sensor
* 😴 IR Eye Blink Sensor

When an unsafe condition is detected, the ESP32 immediately performs multiple safety actions:

* 🔴 Activates an audible buzzer
* 🔴 Turns on a relay
* 🔴 Rotates a servo motor
* 🔴 Changes NeoPixel color
* 🔴 Displays warnings through the Serial Monitor

The project is completely offline and **does not require**:

* Bluetooth
* WiFi
* GPS
* GSM
* Cloud Services
* LCD/OLED Display

---

# ✨ Features

## 🍺 Alcohol Detection

When the MQ-3 sensor detects alcohol above the configured threshold:

* Continuous buzzer alarm
* Relay turns ON
* Servo rotates to **90°**
* NeoPixel changes to **Red**
* Warning printed on Serial Monitor

---

## 😴 Driver Drowsiness Detection

If the IR Eye Blink Sensor detects that the driver's eyes remain closed for more than **2.5 seconds**:

* Buzzer beeps repeatedly
* Relay turns ON
* Servo rotates to **90°**
* NeoPixel changes to **Orange**
* Warning printed on Serial Monitor

---

## ✅ Safe Driving State

When no danger is detected:

* Servo returns to **0°**
* Relay OFF
* Buzzer OFF
* NeoPixel Green
* Serial Monitor displays:

```text
Driver Safe
```
